# Resource configuration for WSO2 AMP deployment
# This file requests higher memory limits for the CrewAI service
# 
# To apply in AMP platform, add these settings in the deployment configuration:
# - Memory limit: 1Gi (increased from 512Mi)
# - Memory request: 768Mi
# - CPU limit: 1000m (increased from 500m)
#
# CrewAI with OpenAI, FAISS, and all tools requires ~600-800MB during execution
# The 1Gi limit provides buffer for multiple concurrent jobs
